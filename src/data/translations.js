    summary: 'Hello, I\'m Melissa. I\'ve recently changed direction in my career and have trained as a full stack web developer after working as a Learning Designer, Product Manager, Writer and Editor in educational publishing for over a decade. I\'m looking for a position within a company where I can work within a team of web developers of differing experiences, bringing with me a range of skills and experience from my previous roles. As a junior developer, I\'d love to work with more experienced developers, so that I can learn from them and grow within this new role. My love of learning and curiosity in the ever-evolving world of web development continue to drive me, with the same question always on the tip of my tongue ... What\'s the next problem for me to solve?',
